# Project Chatbot 

During week one of Technigo's web development bootcamp our task was to create a simple chatbot.
By doing so we got the chance to practice basic Javascript concepts and syntaxes.
I decided to create a moodboster called Bob with a mission to spark som joy or make the user a little bit happier.

Learning goals for this project:

âœ“ How to use variables in JavaScript.

âœ“ How to use conditionals in JavaScript.

âœ“ Know some string methods to modify strings.

âœ“ Understand control flow and the use of conditional statements.

âœ“ How to use functions in JavaScript

âœ“ Different datatypes


## ðŸš¨ The problem

I began by working on basic functionality to practice utilizing functions, event listeners and different variables.
As I gained a better grasp of the fundamentals, I gradually expanded the scope to include more options and integrate more 
creative elements. Styling the components was extra enjoyable and I created my own Bob character and a user icon in an attempt to enhance the overall visual coherence.

With more time at hand, I would have delved deeper into exploring additional user inputs, as well as introducing a wider range of details and variations to enrich the range of possible answers.
